# HANG-HANGMAN

Hang-Hangman is a word guessing game .
The user will be given the game rules , a level choice to play the game at Easy , Medium or Hard.
The user can try to guess the word by inputting letters, if the letter is wrong a visual of the traditional hangman man will start to appear, if the letter is in the word the letter is shown and another guess can be made. Until either all lives are used or the game is won.
The aim is to supply a fun word guessing game to the user.

# Planning Of Hang-Hangman

* When Planning what I thought about and wanted in the game.

  + The user to see and be able to do .
  + The user not to be able to see but the program to do .
  + The game to be easy to use have easy to folow instructions with a logical flow to the  game.
  + I wanted the game to give feed back to the user if the instructions where not followed correctly or if incorrect information was input by accident.
  + I wanted the game to have a bit of color to it to give it a more fun look and to show with the colours instuctions , correct input and incorrect input.

* For the User

  + A nice Introduction
  + Easy to Follow Instructions
  + Clear information to make choices
  + Levels in the Game to keep it Interesting
  + Fun to Play  

# Flowchart

* The logical flow of how I was going to implement the coding of the game

  + Where to use inputs & check inputs.  
  + Where to give user feed back.
  + Where to give choices and direct of game from those choices.
  + Check the logic of the game lay out in order to code accordingly.
 * Note : The flow chart was rough and for me to work from and does not show all the code but assisted me in how I needed to start to code and how the code should flow
