# Planning Of Hang-Hangman

* When Planning what I thought about and wanted in the game.

  + What I wanted the user to see and be able to do .
  + What I wanted the user not to be able to see but the program to do .
  + I wanted the game to be easy to use have easy to folow instructions with a logical flow to the  game.
  + I wanted the game to give feed back to the user if the instructions where not followed correctly or if incorrect information was input by accident.
  + I wanted the game to have a bit of color to it to give it a more fun look and to show with the colours instuctions , correct input and incorrect input.

* For the User

  + A nice Introduction
  + Easy to Follow Instructions
  + Clear information to make choices
  + Levels in the Game to keep it Interesting
  + Fun to Play  

# Flowchart

* The logical flow of how I was going to implement the coding of the game

  + Where to use inputs & check inputs.  
  + Where to give user feed back.
  + Where to give choices and direct of game from those choices.
  + Check the logic of the game lay out in order to code accordingly.
